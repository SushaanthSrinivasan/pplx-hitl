Renewables were already buoyed by record public and private investment in, and demand for, clean energy that set the stage for continued growth in 2024.1 Utility-scale solar and wind capacity additions were the largest across all primary generation sources, accounting for 
close to 90% of all new builds and expansions in the first nine months of 2024, versus 57% of capacity added for the same period in 2023, according to Deloitte analysis of data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.2 Deployment continued to proceed at variable speeds:\n\nSolar was the only primary source of generation that recorded capacity growth, which jumped 88% to 18.6 gigawatts (GW). As a result, in 2024, solar surpassed hydropower and nuclear as the fourth-largest\xa0source of installed capacity, after wind.3\nWind capacity additions fell by 14% to 2.6 GW amid continued supply chain, financing, and permitting challenges.4 Wind generation reached a new record, however, as it exceeded coal-fired generation for two months in a row for the first time.5\nBattery storage accounted for the second-largest share of total generating capacity additions, rising by 64% to 7.4 GW.6 Excess wind and solar generation is the third-largest\xa0use case that utilities report for batteries, following arbitrage and frequency regulation.7\n\nBy the end of 2024, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind capacity to rise to 153.8 GW, up by 6.5 GW from a year earlier. Meanwhile, it expects solar to rise by a record-breaking 38.4 GW to 128.2 GW, and battery storage to rise by a record-breaking 14.9 GW to 30.9 GW.8 The storage boom is also reflected in the distributed segment, with residential solar attachment rates expected to rise from 14% in 2023 to a record 25% in 2024.9\n2025 Energy, Resources, & Industrials Outlooks ---------------------------------------------- Read more from the Deloitte Center for Energy & Industrials’ 2025 outlook collection \nTable of contents\n\nFederal lever\nData centers\nTechnological innovation\nRenewable jobs\nCarbon management\nNavigating 2025\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, the momentum for clean energy may continue, pending new policy approaches from a new administration. The cleantech manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and carbon industries will likely continue to drive renewables deployment:\n\nOn the demand side, many cleantech manufacturing, data center, and direct air capture (DAC) operators are seeking to meet their infrastructural load growth needs with significant shares of renewables.\nOn the supply side, these three industries are helping renewable companies overcome constraints. Reshored cleantech plants are reshaping solar panel and battery storage supply chains. AI is increasingly being leveraged to optimize these supply chains, and to accelerate operational efficiencies and technological innovation in renewables. Meanwhile, the sale of attributes in carbon markets may provide an additional value stream for emerging renewable technology projects.\n\nThe cleantech manufacturing, AI, and carbon industries are now competing among themselves and other industrial customers to meet their infrastructural power demand at least in part with 24/7 clean energy (figure 1).10 Load growth from cleantech manufacturing plants, which could add 11 GW of demand by 2030,
    11 is an anticipated long-term trend resulting from supply chain reshoring to meet domestic energy needs. Less anticipated was the pace and extent of data center load growth to power generative AI model training and use. Deloitte estimates data centers will drive approximately 44 GW of additional demand by 2030. The estimate draws on a range of 26 GW to 33 GW in 2024 to 60 GW to 80 GW by 2030.12\xa0Meanwhile,
    2.7 GW in demand from DAC plants may emerge by 2030.13 This multipronged demand, totaling more than 57 GW by 2030, is currently outpacing supply. Renewables are in a race with other clean generation options to fill the resource gap. Advantages include technological maturity, low cost, and high modularity. Domestic supply chains, AI acceleration of operational and technological innovation, and carbon attribute monetization could provide additional advantages in 2025.\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nDeloitte’s Renewable Energy Industry Outlook draws on insights from our 2024 power and utilities survey, along with analysis of industrial policy, tech capital, new technologies, workforce development, and carbon management, to understand how the new competitive landscape may drive renewables growth amid an infrastructural buildout in the cleantech, AI, and carbon markets.\nFive key trends to watch in 2025 include:\n\nFederal lever: Industrial policy goals shape renewables growth\nData centers: AI expands renewable scale and capabilities\nTechnological innovation: 24/7 renewable solutions 
emerge\nRenewable jobs: Firms address workforce development\nCarbon management: Renewables power high-integrity offsets\n\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\n1. Federal lever: Industrial policy goals shape renewables growth\nUS policymakers share industrial policy goals of strengthening economic competitiveness, national security, and resilience (figure 2). The strategic cleantech manufacturing, AI, and carbon industries may continue to play a critical role in advancing these goals. Their demand for clean energy could limit the appetite for dismantling mechanisms boosting renewables.\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nIn the wake of implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), more than two-thirds of respondents to the 2024 Deloitte power and utilities survey believe the federal government most significantly shapes policies that drive the energy transition (figure 3). As priorities may change under a new administration and the 119th Congress, state and local policy drivers impacting the pace of renewable deployment may become ascendant.\nSome disbursed funding from the IRA could support sub-federal initiatives. For example, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund has created new institutions to deploy potentially perennial sources of funding through green banks and community lenders at the state and local levels.14 Obligated funding from the fund’s Solar for All program, the US$8.3 billion Empowering Rural America program, and US$4.3 billion Climate Pollution Reduction Grants alone may spur the deployment of more than 36 GW of renewables and storage by 2030 across all fifty states.15\nMeanwhile, historical data suggests market-driven growth fundamentals will continue to shape renewable deployment regardless of policy priority changes. Capital cost-sensitive renewables are poised to benefit from currently falling interest rates and subsiding inflation.16\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nCleantech manufacturing: Overall investment in cleantech reached a record US$71 billion in the third quarter of 2024.17 Quarterly records in the retail and manufacturing segments drove the overall record despite tax guidance uncertainty and other factors that contributed to some project delays. Most of the announced projects have not yet broken ground and 60% are slated to begin operations during the next four years. Protection of reshored industry from unfair trade practices will likely translate into continuation of the tariffs imposed in 2024 on solar and batteries.18\nAI: AI is a growing policy priority among policymakers that is expected to remain a key issue in 2025. The Biden administration has led efforts to advance US leadership in AI and the new Trump administration has also stated it will prioritize US AI leadership. Given the AI industry’s high energy needs, efforts to expedite permitting for energy projects serving data centers are likely to continue. Public-private collaboration enabling renewably powered data centers may also continue given the net-zero commitments in the tech sector.\nCarbon: US industrial policy is also building on\xa0multiple Congressional initiatives to measure the carbon intensity of industrial products, including solar panels and wind turbines to leverage the US carbon edge in trade policy.19\xa0Such measurement paved the way for carbon border adjustable tariffs in the European Union.20\nLegislative and regulatory areas to watch that could impact renewable deployment for these industries in 2025:\n\nLegislation\n\nLawmakers may continue to consider permitting reform proposals—another area of bipartisan interest—to facilitate energy project development. The imperative to accelerate new generation and transmission could also help ease major bottlenecks for the existing pipeline of renewable projects to come online.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s stated priorities include lifting a ban on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports targeting non-FTA countries as offtakers, and, as part of permitting reform, expediting LNG terminal development.21 Export capacity with existing projects is already slated to grow 86%, with projects starting to come into service by early 2025.22 The upward pressure and exposure to volatility this would 
place on natural gas prices could enhance the relative competitiveness of renewables vis-à-vis gas in power production.\nMeanwhile, EU rules to reduce methane emissions could boost US production of lower carbon\xa0gas regardless of US regulatory requirements. US exporters of LNG seeking to serve the European market could potentially create additional demand for renewable natural gas.\n\nRegulation\n\nRecent Supreme Court rulings could continue to create uncertainty about the future regulatory environment and the impacts on energy-related rules. These rulings include:\n\nThe revocation of doctrine granting deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes23\nAn expanded statute of limitations to challenge rules24\nCurtailed administrative authority to enforce penalties25\nA stay of agency rules in an emergency appeal26\n\nWhile the Court turned down three other emergency docket requests to stay EPA rules on reducing mercury, methane, and carbon emissions,
    27 these rules remain in litigation and could be impacted by changes with a new administration.\n2. Data centers: AI expands renewable scale and capabilities\nScaling renewables at data center pace\nData center owners are leading the corporate shift toward renewable energy. According to Deloitte analysis of data tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, solar and wind capacity contracted to US data centers has grown to nearly 34 GW through 2024, representing close to half of all renewables contracted to corporations in the United States, and could reach 41 GW by 2030.28 Tech companies that own or lease data centers with a combined capacity of 9 GW, have committed to sourcing all of their power from clean energy.29\nClean energy commitments are running up against power demand growth, however. AI power demand estimates range widely given that only a couple of the major operators report on either data center electricity use or the power usage effectiveness of individual data centers, and none report both.30 Despite uncertainties over long-term growth due to efficiency gains, strong short-term growth is likely. According to Deloitte mid-range estimates, data center power load could grow from 29 
GW to 75 GW by 2030.31 Spending on data center construction has increased 37%, by US$8.2 billion, over the past year ending in October, outpacing the 5% growth, by US$6.3 billion, in spending for power construction.32\nState policies are impacting both renewable and data center growth. State targets help unlock commitments as the local grid mix can constrain clean energy sourcing options. Seventeen US jurisdictions have statutory 100% clean energy requirements covering utilities, with attainment years starting in 203233 (figure 4). Most states also offer data center incentives, which are present in the seven states where data centers’ share of total electricity consumed is expected to be highest in 2030.\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nOver the next year, renewable configurations could change to meet the demand for clean power. At the utility-scale level, modularity and ease of permitting are expected to drive 
contracted solar capacity, which outpaced wind in 2024, to grow to twice the contracted wind capacity in 2025.34 Deals may scale, as reflected in the numerous largest-ever renewable power purchase agreements signed with technology companies this year for data centers globally.35 Value in scaling can also be captured at the distributed level, where there is interest in harnessing existing solar and battery storage resources and developing new ones to help meet data center needs.36\nGiven grid constraints, some companies and utilities are looking to onsite solutions that can help meet demand in a matter of months while awaiting a grid connection.37 In 2024, data center-as-a-service companies and utilities announced off-grid solutions such as fuel cells. Even in cases where natural gas powers them in the short term, fuel cells can bridge to a renewable natural gas or green hydrogen solution.38 New storage solutions geared toward data centers include geopressured geothermal systems and sodium-ion and thermal batteries that can lower operators’ insurance rates by offering nonflammable alternatives to lithium batteries.39\nExpanding renewable capabilities with AI\nAI is helping deploy and integrate the renewables that the industry is seeking to power its infrastructure buildout. Domestically manufactured smart meters incorporating AI may soon help increase grid stability as customer solar and storage systems are integrated.40 Similarly, an 
energy provider and tech company are deploying AI to help build a 1 GW virtual power plant of smart home thermostats and distributed energy resources, in addition to renewable generation and price modeling, and weather forecasting.41 AI-powered robots are helping install large solar deployments in the desert powering data centers.42 On the regulatory side, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory hosts a PolicyAI project that has released a searchable database of federal environmental impact studies and public comment sorting to enable AI solutions expediting environmental and permitting reviews.43 Finally, US Department of Energy (DOE) has funded research using AI to accelerate the development of new circuit technologies for high-voltage direct current converters to help more efficiently integrate remote renewable generation.44\nAs utilities and tech companies deploy renewables in 2025, the following developments are expected:\n\nRepurposing brownfield sites: Limited grid capacity and transmission challenges can create opportunities for brownfield sites to be repurposed as clean-energy data center campuses. Projects could leverage existing power lines, water access, and a local workforce. DOE awarded a GRIP grant to build a grid-enhancing renewable microgrid on a brownfield textile site previously powered with coal to power a data center and manufacturing complex.45\nResource planning renewables: Utility uptake of IRA provisions in 
resource planning is often uneven, although solar and wind are the lowest-cost resources when incentives are factored in.46 Deloitte’s 2024 power and utilities survey shows 97% of utilities prioritize clean energy to support data center growth, suggesting that tech companies with decarbonization targets could drive utilities to consider more renewable deployment as part of data center siting decisions.\nShifting focus to real-world impact of renewable strategies: Some tech companies are seeking to reduce emissions by shifting from unbundled to bundled renewable energy credit purchases and other actions to drive new supply of renewables.\n\n3. Technological innovation: 24/7 renewable solutions emerge\nRecent federal policies have accelerated innovation in renewable technologies that can provide 24/7 clean power. Meanwhile, novel industry partnerships are forming to accelerate their commercialization. These include an initiative from a group of technology and 
manufacturing companies to aggregate their clean power demand to help accelerate the commercialization of advanced technologies.47\xa0Utilities are seeking to introduce new clean transition tariffs for commercial and industrial customers that 
can help finance deployment of these technologies without impacting residential customer rates.48\nDeloitte power and utilities survey respondents believe that advanced nuclear technologies will play the most important role in meeting rising power demand in the next few years (please see 2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook). Among renewable technologies, most believe green hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and advanced solar cell technology will have the greatest role (figure 5).\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nGreen hydrogen: This 24/7 renewable gas technology powered by renewables continues to hold equal measures of promise and uncertainty. DOE has allocated 
US$7 billion to develop hydrogen hubs and five of seven projects have received phase 1 funding to start solidifying planning, development, and design activities around site selection and technology deployment.49\xa0However, the US$3/kg green hydrogen tax credits have proven to be the most complex to iron out and the industry is still awaiting final guidance expected by the end of 2024.50 The incoming Trump administration could potentially revisit the proposed standards, with some industry players expecting loosened rules.51 Again, stricter European standards could boost green hydrogen production seeking to serve the largest export market opportunity. Another area to watch that could sidestep this issue altogether is the search for naturally occurring hydrogen by technology and manufacturing company-backed startups.\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES): Regardless of the trajectory of these policy and technology outcomes, green hydrogen would retain its primary use case in the power sector as LDES, among other emerging storage solutions that can firm renewables into 24/7 resources. LDES technologies that received federal funding in 2024 include:\n\nGreen hydrogen production from a Superfund site’s wastewater to provide 16 hours of storage for solar power52\nIron-air battery deployment to store offshore wind power and discharge 85 MW of power for up to 100 hours, which would form the world’s largest battery53\n\nAdvanced solar cell technology: Innovation in silicon, perovskite, and tandem solar cells offers potential for higher efficiency rates and lower production costs.54 Advances involve 24/7 capabilities in the form of dual-use applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics, agrivoltaics colocating solar generation with agriculture, and floatovoltaics that can help address both energy and water concerns.\nEnhanced geothermal systems (EGS): Rapidly maturing EGS that can provide 24/7 baseload electricity by accessing deep heat reservoirs is benefiting from federal funding and cross-sector investment in technological advances such as new drilling techniques and extreme heat operations, and bipartisan support to fast-track projects.55 Technology companies are partnering with developers to deliver geothermal power, and with utilities to support EGS deployments using a clean transition tariff to shoulder the cost and risk of deploying a new technology.56 Meanwhile, a utility signed the largest geothermal power purchase agreement, totaling 320 MW, to meet a public utility commission requirement to procure 24/7 carbon-free power.57\n4. Renewable jobs: Firms address workforce development\nThe acceleration of mature and emerging renewable infrastructure buildout is reflected in renewable employment growth. Clean energy jobs accounted for more than half of energy jobs created in 2023, and 79% of new electric power generation jobs; these jobs grew at twice the rate 
of jobs across the economy, while energy construction jobs grew at twice the rate of all construction jobs.58 Hiring in renewables has grown to twice the level of hiring in fossil fuels.59\nSolar energy accounts for two-thirds of renewable jobs and wind accounts for a fifth (figure 6). While California and Texas continue to lead in terms of total renewable jobs and growth rates for emerging technologies,\xa0Wyoming and Montana have emerged as the fastest-growing regions, increasing renewable energy employment by 23% and 15%, respectively.60\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nThe utility industry, which has the greatest share and demand for green skills—led by renewable energy and electrification—competes with the technology industry, which has the fastest growth in green skill demand. And it competes with all other infrastructure-building industries for construction workers (please see 2025 Engineering and Construction Industry Outlook).61 Utilities and renewable developers face challenges including: securing a larger workforce, developing digital and project development skills, and hiring for completely new roles as they diversify their renewable portfolios (figure 7).62\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nMany organizations may not be prepared to create workforce development programs, which should proactively implement (please see the\xa0Workforce Development Maturity Model):\n\nIntegrated workforce development strategy, structure, and governance to invest in workforce development, establish a structure to assess workforce needs, articulate organizational goals, and the partnerships 
to achieve progress toward those goals.\nPreparation for the changing nature of skills to identify and clearly define the future-facing skills required for the workforce, measure skills gaps, and engage the workforce to strengthen areas of weakness.\nExternal workforce cultivation to tap rich sources of recruitment outside an organization, building relationships and targeted messaging to attract interest, and providing inroads for recruitment and upskilling.\nLong-term external workforce development and planning to take a wider, longer-term lens to the external workforce, partnering with others in the industry and across communities to promote a continuous pipeline of candidates for recruitment.\nExternal skill programming and development to identify emerging career opportunities and skills in the industry, develop proficiency metrics, and engage external partners in recruitment candidate preparation.\nPolicy and industry engagement to monitor legislation, engage federal agencies and workforce boards, and actively partner within the industry sector to advance workforce development priorities.\nOrganizational culture and brand to align with the organization’s future-facing workforce goals and embed culture from onboarding throughout career journeys.\nInternal training and development to assess and address skill development and provide clear paths of advancement to encourage continuous learning and loyalty.\n\nOrganizations that move up the maturity curve can strengthen, diversify, and upskill their talent pipelines. They may also start reaping the results of industry ecosystem partnerships from DOE-funded workforce readiness programs to support education and training tied to apprenticeship programs with organizations that have hiring commitments. Unions, educational institutions, trade schools, and apprenticeships are expected to begin implementing some of these programs in 2025.\n5. Carbon management: Renewables power high-integrity offsets\nRenewables are core to carbon management taking center stage in the power industry. Seventy-two percent of respondents to the Deloitte power and utilities survey indicate their organizations have a strategy to reduce or help customers reduce carbon emissions, primarily to meet sustainability goals, while most respondents with partial integration invoked a learning curve challenge (figure 8). Renewables contribute to high-integrity carbon management solutions in two ways: by powering DAC infrastructure and providing an emerging carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approach.\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nVoluntary offset markets shift to CDR credits\nAmid recent questions of credit validity and integrity in voluntary carbon markets, organizations have pivoted from purchases of renewable energy offsets to focus on operational decarbonization and carbon removal.63 Voluntary credits tied to renewable projects peaked in 2021 with 83.7 million carbon offset purchases, dropping to 59.4 million in 2023\xa0but still accounting for 36.6% of total offset purchases.64 At issue is that funding from carbon offsets has a negligible impact 
on the buildout of already low-cost solar and wind resources. Meanwhile, the emerging CDR credit market has seen a significant increase in investment, particularly from technology companies. CDR credit purchases grew from 4 million\xa0to 6.6 million tons between the first three quarters of 2023 and of 2024.65\xa0Credits generated from renewable-powered or emerging renewable methods such as DAC and bioenergy with carbon capture, and storage, account for 84% of purchases (figure 9).66\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nStrong CDR credit sale activity coupled with comparatively high prices is reflective of market desire for and confidence in CDR methods to drive real removals (figure 10). High price levels may provide a monetization pathway for emerging renewable energy providers to partner with CDR projects and negotiate shares of generated credits. The industry has recently called for statutory standards to improve monitoring, reporting, and verification to drive further confidence in removal schemes.67 The US federal government’s release of guiding principles for the development of high-integrity voluntary carbon markets and the emergence of a global carbon market could also help firm demand.68\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nDAC and data center infrastructure intersect on resource constraints and opportunities\nThe United States has three operational DAC facilities, with 13 more in various stages of development,
    69\xa0including two that have received a combined US$1.2 billion from the DOE DAC Hubs program,
    70\xa0which aims to develop four hubs in total (figure 11).71 Some facilities are facing clean energy procurement challenges. A facility in Wyoming, planned to be one of the largest DAC facilities in the world, recently scrapped its plans as it claimed it could not procure enough emission-free energy, citing rising competition for renewables from data centers.72\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nOnly two of the projects are premised on using captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery, a longstanding revenue stream for captured carbon. Most plan to utilize dedicated storage or sell captured carbon for direct use.73 An opportunity for captured carbon sale and use is in the development of lower-emission cement,
    74 which can support the increasing demand for green concrete driven by AI data center growth.75\nIn 2025, pending policy developments from the new administration, carbon management technologies are poised for growth driven by more robust carbon market guidelines, significant supplier delivery obligations, and revenue opportunities.\nClean energy 2025:\xa0Renewables filling the demand gap\nThe year 2025 will be defined by a race to overcome constraints and fill a growing gap between supply and demand for clean energy. Market and technology advantages such as low cost and modularity could be even more important amid policy uncertainty in the coming year. The growing cleantech manufacturing, AI, and carbon industries will likely continue supporting renewables supply through domestic renewable supply chain development, AI-accelerated operational efficiencies and innovation, and carbon attribute monetization. Industrial policy, capital from technology companies committed to sustainability targets, new renewable technologies with 24/7 capabilities, more mature workforce development models, and high-integrity carbon management can help renewables maintain momentum.\nAbout the Deloitte survey\nTo understand the outlook and perspectives of organizations across the power and utilities industry, Deloitte fielded a survey of 60 US executives and other senior leaders in September 2024. The survey captured insights from respondents in the generation, transmission, and distribution segments.\nShow more\nAccess the archive\n\n2024 renewable energy industry outlook\n2023 renewable energy industry outlook\n2022 renewable energy industry outlook\n2021 renewable energy industry outlook\nMidyear 2020 renewable energy industry outlook\n2020 renewable energy industry outlook\n\nShow more\nContinue the conversation\nMeet the industry leaders\n\nMarlene Motyka\nUS Renewable Energy leader Deloitte Transactions and Business Analytics LLP\n\nTom Keefe\nUS Power, Utilities & Renewables leader | Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\nKate Hardin\nDeloitte Center for Energy and Industrials | Executive director\n\n${leaderName4

Another area to watch that could sidestep this issue altogether is the search for naturally occurring hydrogen by technology and manufacturing company-backed startups. [...] On the supply side, these three industries are helping renewable companies overcome constraints. Reshored cleantech plants are reshaping solar panel and battery storage supply chains. AI is increasingly being leveraged to optimize these supply chains, and to accelerate operational efficiencies and technological innovation in renewables.

Renewables were already buoyed by record public and private investment in, and demand for, clean energy that set the stage for continued growth in 2024.1 Utility-scale solar and wind capacity additions were the largest across all primary generation sources, accounting for close to 90% of all new builds and expansions in the first nine months of 2024, versus 57% of capacity added for the same period in 2023, according to Deloitte analysis of data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.2 Deployment continued to proceed at variable speeds:\n\nSolar was the only primary source of generation that recorded capacity growth, which jumped 88% to 18.6 gigawatts (GW). As a result, in 2024, solar surpassed hydropower and nuclear as the fourth-largest\xa0source of installed capacity, after wind.3\nWind capacity additions fell by 14% to 2.6 GW amid continued supply chain, financing, and permitting challenges.4 Wind generation reached a new record, however, as it exceeded coal-fired generation for two months in a row for the first time.5\nBattery storage accounted for the second-largest share of total generating capacity additions, rising by 64% to 7.4 GW.6 Excess wind and solar generation is the third-largest\xa0use case that utilities report for batteries, following arbitrage and frequency regulation.7\n\nBy the end of 2024, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind capacity to rise to 153.8 GW, up by 6.5 GW from a year earlier. Meanwhile, it expects solar to rise by a record-breaking 38.4 GW 
to 128.2 GW, and battery storage to rise by a record-breaking 14.9 GW to 30.9 GW.8 The storage boom is also reflected in the distributed segment, with residential solar attachment rates expected to rise from 14% in 2023 to a record 25% in 2024.9\n2025 Energy, Resources, & Industrials Outlooks ---------------------------------------------- Read more from the Deloitte Center for Energy & Industrials’ 2025 outlook collection \nTable of contents\n\nFederal lever\nData centers\nTechnological innovation\nRenewable jobs\nCarbon management\nNavigating 2025\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, the momentum for clean energy may continue, pending new policy approaches from a new administration. The cleantech manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and carbon industries will likely continue to drive renewables deployment:\n\nOn the demand side, many cleantech manufacturing, data center, and direct air capture (DAC) operators are seeking to meet their infrastructural load growth needs with significant shares of renewables.\nOn the supply side, these three industries are helping renewable companies overcome constraints. Reshored cleantech plants are reshaping solar panel and battery storage supply chains. AI is increasingly being leveraged to optimize these supply chains, and to accelerate operational efficiencies and technological innovation in renewables. Meanwhile, the sale of attributes in carbon markets may provide an additional value stream for emerging renewable technology projects.\n\nThe cleantech manufacturing, AI, and carbon industries are now competing among themselves and other industrial customers to meet their infrastructural power demand at least in part with 24/7 clean energy (figure 1).10 Load growth from cleantech manufacturing plants, which could add 11 GW of demand by 2030,
    11 is an anticipated long-term trend resulting from supply chain reshoring to meet domestic energy needs. Less anticipated was the pace and extent of data center load growth to power generative AI model training and use. Deloitte estimates data centers will drive approximately 44 GW of additional demand by 2030. The estimate draws on a range of 26 GW to 33 GW in 2024 to 60 GW to 80 GW by 2030.12\xa0Meanwhile,
    2.7 GW in demand from DAC plants may emerge by 2030.13 This multipronged demand, totaling more than 57 GW by 2030, is currently outpacing supply. Renewables are in a race with other clean generation options to fill the resource gap. Advantages include technological maturity, low cost, and high modularity. Domestic supply chains, AI acceleration of operational and technological innovation, and carbon attribute monetization could provide additional advantages in 2025.\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nDeloitte’s Renewable Energy Industry Outlook draws on insights from our 2024 power and utilities survey, along with analysis of industrial policy, tech 
capital, new technologies, workforce development, and carbon management, to understand how the new competitive landscape may drive renewables growth amid an infrastructural buildout in the cleantech, AI, and carbon markets.\nFive key trends to watch in 2025 include:\n\nFederal lever: Industrial policy goals shape renewables growth\nData centers: AI expands renewable scale and capabilities\nTechnological innovation: 24/7 renewable solutions emerge\nRenewable jobs: Firms address workforce development\nCarbon management: Renewables power high-integrity offsets\n\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\n1. Federal lever: Industrial policy goals shape renewables growth\nUS policymakers 
share industrial policy goals of strengthening economic competitiveness, national security, and resilience (figure 2). The strategic cleantech manufacturing, AI, and carbon industries may continue to play a critical role in advancing these goals. Their demand for clean energy could limit the appetite for dismantling mechanisms boosting renewables.\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nIn the wake of implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), more than two-thirds of respondents to the 2024 Deloitte power and utilities survey believe the federal government most significantly shapes policies that drive the energy transition (figure 3). As priorities may change under a new administration and the 119th Congress, state and local policy drivers impacting the pace of renewable deployment may become ascendant.\nSome disbursed funding from the IRA could support sub-federal initiatives. For example, the US$27 billion 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund has created new institutions to deploy potentially perennial sources of funding through green banks and community lenders at the state and local levels.14 Obligated funding from the fund’s Solar for All program, the US$8.3 billion Empowering Rural America program, and US$4.3 billion Climate Pollution Reduction Grants alone may spur the deployment of more than 36 GW of renewables and storage by 2030 across all fifty states.15\nMeanwhile, historical data suggests market-driven growth fundamentals will continue to shape renewable deployment regardless of policy priority changes. Capital cost-sensitive renewables are poised to benefit from currently falling interest rates and subsiding inflation.16\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nCleantech manufacturing: Overall investment in cleantech reached a record US$71 billion in the third quarter of 2024.17 Quarterly records in the retail and manufacturing segments drove the overall record despite tax guidance uncertainty and other factors that contributed to some project delays. Most of the announced projects have not yet broken ground and 60% are slated to begin operations during the next four years. Protection of reshored industry from unfair trade practices will likely translate into continuation of the tariffs imposed in 2024 on solar and batteries.18\nAI: AI is a growing policy priority among policymakers that is expected to remain a key issue in 2025. The Biden administration has led efforts to advance US leadership in AI and the new Trump administration has also stated it will prioritize US AI leadership. Given the AI industry’s high energy needs, efforts to expedite permitting for energy projects serving data centers are likely to continue. Public-private collaboration enabling renewably powered data centers may also continue given the net-zero commitments in the tech sector.\nCarbon: US industrial policy is also building on\xa0multiple Congressional initiatives to measure the carbon intensity of industrial products, including solar panels and wind turbines to leverage the US carbon edge in trade policy.19\xa0Such measurement paved the way for carbon border adjustable tariffs in the European Union.20\nLegislative and regulatory areas to watch that could impact renewable deployment for these industries in 2025:\n\nLegislation\n\nLawmakers may continue to consider permitting reform proposals—another area of bipartisan interest—to facilitate energy project development. The imperative to accelerate new generation and transmission could also help ease major bottlenecks for the existing pipeline of renewable projects to come online.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s stated priorities include lifting a ban on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports targeting non-FTA countries as offtakers, and, as part of permitting reform, expediting LNG terminal development.21 Export capacity with existing projects is already slated to grow 86%, with projects starting to come into service by early 2025.22 The upward pressure and exposure to volatility this would place on natural gas prices could enhance 
the relative competitiveness of renewables vis-à-vis gas in power production.\nMeanwhile, EU rules to reduce methane emissions could boost US production of lower carbon\xa0gas regardless of US regulatory requirements. US exporters of LNG seeking to serve the European market could potentially create additional demand for renewable natural gas.\n\nRegulation\n\nRecent Supreme Court rulings could continue to create uncertainty about the future regulatory environment and the impacts on energy-related rules. These rulings include:\n\nThe revocation of doctrine granting deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes23\nAn expanded statute of limitations to challenge rules24\nCurtailed administrative authority to enforce penalties25\nA stay of agency rules in an emergency appeal26\n\nWhile the Court turned down three other emergency docket requests to stay EPA rules on reducing mercury, methane, and carbon emissions,
    27 these rules remain in litigation and could be impacted by changes with a new administration.\n2. Data centers: AI expands renewable scale and capabilities\nScaling renewables at data center pace\nData center owners are leading the corporate shift toward renewable energy. According to Deloitte analysis of data tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, solar and wind capacity contracted to US data centers has grown to nearly 34 GW through 2024, representing close to half of all renewables contracted to corporations in the United States, and could reach 41 GW by 2030.28 Tech companies that own or lease data centers with a combined capacity of 9 GW, have committed to sourcing all of their power from clean energy.29\nClean energy commitments are running up against power demand growth, however. AI power demand estimates range widely given that only a couple of the major operators report on either data center electricity use or the power usage effectiveness of individual data centers, and none report both.30 Despite uncertainties over long-term growth due to efficiency gains, strong short-term growth is likely. According to Deloitte mid-range estimates, data center power load could grow from 29 GW to 75 GW by 2030.31 Spending on data center construction has increased 37%, by US$8.2 billion, over the past year ending in October, outpacing the 5% growth, by US$6.3 billion, in spending for power construction.32\nState policies are impacting both renewable and data center growth. State targets help unlock commitments as the local grid mix can constrain clean energy sourcing options. Seventeen US jurisdictions have statutory 100% clean energy requirements covering utilities, with attainment years starting in 203233 (figure 4). Most states also offer data center incentives, which are present in the seven states where data centers’ share of total electricity consumed is expected to be highest in 2030.\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nOver the next year, renewable configurations could change to meet the demand for clean power. At the utility-scale level, modularity and ease of permitting are expected to drive contracted solar capacity, which outpaced 
wind in 2024, to grow to twice the contracted wind capacity in 2025.34 Deals may scale, as reflected in the numerous largest-ever renewable power purchase agreements signed with technology companies this year for data centers globally.35 Value in scaling can also be captured at the distributed level, where there is interest in harnessing existing solar and battery storage resources and developing new ones to help meet data center needs.36\nGiven grid constraints, some companies and utilities are looking to onsite solutions that can help meet demand in a matter of months while awaiting a grid connection.37 In 2024, data center-as-a-service companies and utilities announced off-grid solutions such as fuel cells. Even in cases where natural gas powers them in the short term, fuel cells can bridge to a renewable natural gas or green hydrogen solution.38 New storage solutions geared toward data centers include geopressured geothermal systems and sodium-ion and thermal batteries that can lower operators’ insurance rates by offering nonflammable alternatives to lithium batteries.39\nExpanding renewable capabilities with AI\nAI is helping deploy and integrate the renewables that the industry is seeking to power its infrastructure buildout. Domestically manufactured smart meters incorporating AI may soon help increase grid stability as customer solar and storage systems are integrated.40 Similarly, an energy provider and tech company are deploying AI to help build a 1 GW virtual power plant of smart home thermostats and distributed energy resources, in addition to renewable generation and price modeling, and weather forecasting.41 AI-powered robots are helping install large solar deployments in the desert powering data centers.42 On the regulatory side, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory hosts a PolicyAI project that has released a searchable database of federal environmental impact studies and public comment sorting to enable AI solutions expediting environmental and permitting reviews.43 Finally, US Department of Energy (DOE) has funded research using AI to accelerate the development of new circuit technologies for high-voltage direct current converters to help more efficiently integrate remote renewable generation.44\nAs utilities and tech companies deploy renewables in 2025, the following developments are expected:\n\nRepurposing brownfield sites: Limited grid capacity and transmission challenges can create opportunities for brownfield sites to be repurposed as clean-energy data center campuses. Projects could leverage existing power lines, water access, and a local workforce. DOE awarded a GRIP grant to build a grid-enhancing renewable microgrid on a brownfield textile site previously powered with coal to power a data center and manufacturing complex.45\nResource planning renewables: Utility uptake of IRA provisions in resource planning is often uneven, although solar and wind are the lowest-cost resources when incentives are factored in.46 Deloitte’s 2024 power and utilities survey shows 97% of utilities prioritize clean energy to support data center growth, suggesting that tech companies with decarbonization targets could drive utilities to consider more renewable deployment as part of data center siting decisions.\nShifting focus to real-world impact of renewable strategies: Some tech companies are seeking to reduce emissions by shifting from unbundled to bundled renewable energy credit purchases and other actions to drive new supply of renewables.\n\n3. Technological innovation: 24/7 renewable solutions emerge\nRecent federal policies have accelerated innovation in renewable technologies that can provide 24/7 clean power. Meanwhile, novel industry partnerships are forming to accelerate their commercialization. These include an initiative from a group of technology and manufacturing companies to aggregate their clean power demand to help accelerate the commercialization of advanced technologies.47\xa0Utilities are seeking to introduce new clean transition tariffs for commercial and industrial customers that can help finance deployment of these technologies without impacting residential customer rates.48\nDeloitte power and utilities survey respondents believe that advanced nuclear technologies will play the most important role in meeting rising power demand in the next few years (please 
see 2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook). Among renewable technologies, most believe green hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and advanced solar cell technology will have the greatest role (figure 5).\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nGreen hydrogen: This 24/7 renewable gas technology powered by renewables continues to hold equal measures of promise and uncertainty. DOE has allocated US$7 billion to develop hydrogen hubs and 
five of seven projects have received phase 1 funding to start solidifying planning, development, and design activities around site selection and technology deployment.49\xa0However, the US$3/kg green hydrogen tax credits have proven to be the 
most complex to iron out and the industry is still awaiting final guidance expected by the end of 2024.50 The incoming Trump administration could potentially revisit the proposed standards, with some industry players expecting loosened rules.51 Again, stricter European standards could boost green hydrogen production seeking to serve the largest export market opportunity. Another area to watch that could sidestep this issue altogether is the search for naturally occurring hydrogen by technology and manufacturing company-backed startups.\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES): Regardless of the trajectory of these policy and technology outcomes, green hydrogen would retain its primary use case in the power sector as LDES, among other emerging storage solutions that can firm renewables into 24/7 resources. LDES technologies that received federal funding in 2024 include:\n\nGreen hydrogen production from a Superfund site’s wastewater to provide 16 hours of storage for solar power52\nIron-air battery deployment to store offshore wind power and discharge 85 MW of power for up to 100 hours, which would form the world’s largest battery53\n\nAdvanced solar cell technology: Innovation in silicon, perovskite, and tandem solar cells offers potential for higher efficiency rates and lower production costs.54 Advances involve 24/7 capabilities in the form of dual-use applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics, agrivoltaics colocating solar generation with agriculture, and floatovoltaics that can help address both energy and water concerns.\nEnhanced geothermal systems (EGS): Rapidly maturing EGS that can provide 24/7 baseload electricity by accessing deep heat reservoirs is benefiting from federal funding and cross-sector investment in technological advances such as new drilling techniques and extreme heat operations, and bipartisan support to fast-track projects.55 Technology companies are partnering with developers to deliver geothermal power, and with utilities to support EGS deployments using a clean transition tariff to shoulder the cost and risk of deploying a new technology.56 Meanwhile, a utility signed the largest geothermal power purchase agreement, totaling 320 MW, to meet a public utility commission requirement to procure 24/7 carbon-free power.57\n4. Renewable jobs: Firms address workforce development\nThe acceleration of mature and emerging renewable infrastructure buildout is reflected in renewable employment growth. Clean energy jobs accounted for more than half of energy jobs created in 2023, and 79% of new electric power generation jobs; these jobs grew at twice the rate of jobs across the economy, while energy construction jobs grew at twice the rate of all construction jobs.58 Hiring in renewables has grown to twice the level of hiring in fossil fuels.59\nSolar energy accounts for two-thirds of renewable jobs and wind accounts for a fifth (figure 6). While California and Texas continue to lead in terms of total renewable jobs and growth rates for emerging technologies,\xa0Wyoming and Montana have emerged as the fastest-growing regions, increasing renewable energy employment by 23% and 15%, respectively.60\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nThe utility industry, which has the greatest share and demand for green skills—led by renewable energy and electrification—competes with the technology industry, which has the fastest growth in green skill demand. And it competes with all other infrastructure-building industries for construction workers (please see 2025 Engineering and Construction Industry Outlook).61 Utilities and renewable developers face challenges including: securing a larger workforce, developing digital and project development skills, and hiring for completely new roles as they diversify their renewable portfolios (figure 7).62\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nMany organizations may not be prepared to create workforce development programs, which should proactively implement (please see the\xa0Workforce Development Maturity Model):\n\nIntegrated workforce development strategy, structure, and governance to invest in workforce development, establish a structure to assess workforce needs, articulate organizational goals, and the partnerships to achieve progress toward those goals.\nPreparation for the changing nature of skills to identify and clearly define the future-facing skills required for the workforce, measure skills gaps, and engage the workforce to strengthen areas of weakness.\nExternal workforce cultivation to 
tap rich sources of recruitment outside an organization, building relationships and targeted messaging to attract interest, and providing inroads for recruitment and upskilling.\nLong-term external workforce development and planning to take a 
wider, longer-term lens to the external workforce, partnering with others in the industry and across communities to promote a continuous pipeline of candidates for recruitment.\nExternal skill programming and development to identify emerging career opportunities and skills in the industry, develop proficiency metrics, and engage external partners in recruitment candidate preparation.\nPolicy and industry engagement to monitor legislation, engage federal agencies and workforce boards, and actively partner within the industry sector to advance workforce development priorities.\nOrganizational culture and brand to align with the organization’s future-facing workforce goals and embed culture from onboarding throughout career journeys.\nInternal training and development to assess and address skill development and provide clear paths of advancement to encourage continuous learning and loyalty.\n\nOrganizations that move up the maturity curve can strengthen, diversify, and upskill their talent pipelines. They may also start reaping the results of industry ecosystem partnerships from DOE-funded workforce readiness programs to support education and training tied to apprenticeship programs with organizations that have hiring commitments. Unions, educational institutions, trade schools, and apprenticeships are expected to begin implementing some of these programs in 2025.\n5. Carbon management: Renewables power high-integrity offsets\nRenewables are core to carbon management taking center stage in the power industry. Seventy-two percent of respondents to the Deloitte power and utilities survey indicate their organizations have a strategy to reduce or help customers reduce carbon emissions, primarily to meet sustainability goals, while most respondents with partial integration invoked a learning curve challenge (figure 8). Renewables contribute to high-integrity carbon management solutions in two ways: by powering DAC infrastructure and providing an emerging carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approach.\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nVoluntary offset markets shift to CDR credits\nAmid recent questions of credit validity and integrity in voluntary carbon markets, organizations have pivoted from purchases of renewable energy offsets to focus on operational decarbonization and carbon removal.63 Voluntary credits tied to renewable projects peaked in 2021 with 83.7 million carbon offset purchases, dropping to 59.4 million in 2023\xa0but still accounting for 36.6% of total offset purchases.64 At issue is that funding from carbon offsets has a negligible impact on the buildout of already low-cost solar 
and wind resources. Meanwhile, the emerging CDR credit market has seen a significant increase in investment, particularly from technology companies. CDR credit purchases grew from 4 million\xa0to 6.6 million tons between the first three quarters of 2023 and of 2024.65\xa0Credits generated from renewable-powered or emerging renewable methods such as DAC and bioenergy with carbon capture, and storage, account for 84% of purchases (figure 9).66\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nStrong CDR credit sale activity coupled with comparatively high prices is reflective of market desire for and confidence in CDR methods to drive real removals (figure 10). High price levels may provide a monetization pathway for emerging renewable energy providers to partner with CDR projects and negotiate shares of generated credits. The industry has recently called for statutory standards to improve monitoring, reporting, and verification to drive further confidence in removal schemes.67 The US federal government’s release of guiding principles for the development of high-integrity voluntary carbon markets and the emergence of a global carbon market could also help firm demand.68\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nDAC and data center infrastructure intersect on resource constraints and opportunities\nThe United States has three operational DAC facilities, with 13 more in various stages of development,
    69\xa0including two that have received a combined US$1.2 billion from the DOE DAC Hubs program,
    70\xa0which aims to develop four hubs in total (figure 11).71 Some facilities are facing clean energy procurement challenges. A facility in Wyoming, planned to be one of the largest DAC facilities in the world, recently scrapped its plans as it claimed it could not procure enough emission-free energy, citing rising competition for renewables from data centers.72\n\nShare image\n\nShare\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy\nOnly two of the projects are premised on using captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery, a longstanding revenue stream for captured carbon. Most plan to utilize dedicated storage or sell captured carbon for direct use.73 An opportunity for captured carbon sale and use is in the development of lower-emission cement,
    74 which can support the increasing demand for green concrete driven by AI data center growth.75\nIn 2025, pending policy developments from the new administration, carbon management technologies are poised for growth driven by more robust carbon market guidelines, significant supplier delivery obligations, and revenue opportunities.\nClean energy 2025:\xa0Renewables filling the demand gap\nThe year 2025 will be defined by a race to overcome constraints and fill a growing gap between supply and demand for clean energy. Market and technology advantages such as low cost and modularity could be even more important amid policy uncertainty in the coming year. The growing cleantech manufacturing, AI, and carbon industries will likely continue supporting renewables supply through domestic renewable supply chain 
development, AI-accelerated operational efficiencies and innovation, and carbon attribute monetization. Industrial policy, capital from technology companies committed to sustainability targets, new renewable technologies with 24/7 capabilities, more mature workforce development models, and high-integrity carbon management can help renewables maintain momentum.\nAbout the Deloitte survey\nTo understand the outlook and perspectives of organizations across the power and utilities industry, Deloitte fielded a survey of 60 US executives and other senior leaders in September 2024. The survey captured insights from respondents in the generation, transmission, and distribution segments.\nShow more\nAccess the archive\n\n2024 renewable energy industry outlook\n2023 renewable energy industry outlook\n2022 renewable energy industry outlook\n2021 renewable energy industry outlook\nMidyear 2020 renewable energy industry outlook\n2020 renewable energy industry outlook\n\nShow more\nContinue the conversation\nMeet the industry leaders\n\nMarlene Motyka\nUS Renewable Energy leader Deloitte Transactions and Business Analytics LLP\n\nTom Keefe\nUS Power, Utilities & Renewables leader | Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\nKate Hardin\nDeloitte Center for Energy and Industrials | Executive director\n\n${leaderName4

2025\nNew York, January 30,
    2024 – Global investment in the low-carbon energy transition surged 17% in 2023, reaching $1.77 trillion, according to Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024, a report published today by research provider BloombergNEF (BNEF). This number is a new record level of annual investment and demonstrates the resilience of the clean energy transition in a year of geopolitical turbulence, high interest rates and cost inflation.\nThe report finds that electrified transport is now the largest sector for spending in the energy transition, growing 36% in 2023 to $634 billion. This figure includes spending on electric cars, buses, two- and three-wheelers and commercial vehicles, as well as associated infrastructure.\nElectrified transport overtook the renewable energy sector, which saw an 8% increase to $623 billion. This figure reflects investment to construct renewable energy production facilities, such as wind, solar and geothermal power plants, and biofuels production plants – among other things. Power grid investment was the third-largest contributor at $310 billion. Grids are a critical enabler for the energy transition, and investment in them will need to rise in the coming 
years.\n“Last year brought new records for global renewable energy investment. Strong growth in the US and Europe drove the global rise, even as China, the world’s largest renewables market, sputtered, recording an 11% drop. Despite a year of 
tough headlines, a record amount of offshore wind capacity also reached financial close,” said Meredith Annex, BNEF’s Head of Clean Power and co-author of the report.\nThere was also strong growth in emerging areas such as hydrogen (with investment tripling year on year), carbon capture and storage (near-doubling) and energy storage (up 76%).\n\nThe largest country for investment by far was China, with $676 billion invested in 2023 – equivalent to 38% of the global total. Although 
China remains dominant, its lead has been reduced. Taken together, the European Union, US and UK outpaced China with $737 billion of investment – a feat they hadn’t managed to achieve in 2022. Investment in the US jumped 22% year-on-year, to $303 billion, as the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act started to be felt.\n\nThe current level of investment in clean energy technologies is not nearly sufficient to set the world on track for net zero by mid-century. According to the report, energy transition investment would need to average $4.8 trillion per year from 2024 to 2030 to align with BNEF’s Net Zero Scenario, a Paris Agreement-aligned trajectory from the 2022 New Energy Outlook. This is nearly three times the total investment observed in 2023.\n“Our report shows just how quickly the clean energy opportunity is growing, and yet how far off track we still are,” said Albert Cheung, Deputy CEO of BNEF. “Energy transition investment spending grew 17% last year, but it needs to grow more than 170% if we are to get on track for net zero in the coming years. Only determined action from policymakers can unlock this kind of step-change in momentum.”\nIn addition, BNEF’s report finds that investment in the global clean energy supply chain, including equipment factories and battery metals production for energy technologies, hit a new record at $135 billion in 2023 (up from just $46 billion in 2020), and is set to surge further over the next two years. BNEF projects this figure to rise to $259 billion by 2025, based on currently announced investment plans. In the next two years, only the wind sector needs to increase its supply chain investment to get on track for a net-zero trajectory; the other areas are investing at a sufficient pace.\nAntoine Vagneur-Jones, Head of Trade and Supply Chains at BNEF, said, “Abundant supply chain investment should continue to tamp down equipment prices across most sectors, which is good news for the energy transition. But the ensuing oversupply heralds an era of squeezed margins for solar and battery manufacturers.”\nAside from tracking the funding for clean energy deployment and clean energy supply chain investment, the Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024 report also tracks two other types of funding:\nClimate-tech equity raising: Equity raised by companies focused on climate and the energy transition ($84 billion in 2023)\no This figure has fallen for the past two years, as rising interest rates have made it harder for companies to raise capital. Companies had raised $168 billion in 2021 and $127 billion in 2022.\no Clean energy-focused companies raised more equity than any other sector in 2023, at $49 billion.\no Companies in the clean transport sector saw funding drop the most sharply, from $47 billion raised in 2022 to just $18 billion in 2023. Transport remained the second-largest funding sector, followed by Industry, Buildings, Agriculture and ‘Climate and Carbon’.\nEnergy transition debt issuance: Debt issued by companies and governments to fund the energy transition ($824 billion in 2023)\no This figure rose by 4% in 2023 after dropping 10% in 2022. Stabilizing 
or falling interest rates in various markets helped companies and governments raise debt for energy transition purposes and these trends are reflective of the broader market.\no Utilities raised the most debt for the energy transition ($328 billion), followed by financial institutions ($176 billion) and governments ($141 billion)\no Oil and gas companies’ energy transition debt issuance fell to $8.3 billion, down from $17.5 billion in 2022.\nContact\nOktavia Catsaros\nBloombergNEF\n+1 212 617 9209\nocatsaros@bloomberg.net\nAbout Bloomberg\nBloomberg is a global leader in business and financial information, delivering trusted data, news, and insights that bring transparency, efficiency, and fairness to markets.

    2024\n• BloombergNEF’s Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024 finds that renewable energy, electric vehicles, hydrogen and carbon capture all drive investment growth year-on-year\n• China leads with $676 billion invested in 2023, or 38% of the global total\n• Together, the EU, US and UK invested more than China in 2023, which was not the case in 2022\n• Investment in the clean energy supply chain hit $135 billion globally in 2023, and could rise to $259 billion by 2025\nNew York, January 30,
    2024 – Global investment in the low-carbon energy transition surged 17% in 2023, reaching $1.77 trillion, according to Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024, a report published today by research provider BloombergNEF (BNEF). This number is a new record level of annual investment and demonstrates the resilience of the clean energy transition in a year of geopolitical turbulence, high interest rates and cost inflation.\nThe report finds that electrified transport is now the largest sector for spending in the energy transition, growing 36% in 2023 to $634 billion. This figure includes spending on electric cars, buses, two- and three-wheelers and commercial vehicles, as well as associated infrastructure.\nElectrified transport overtook the renewable energy sector, which saw an 8% increase to $623 billion. This figure reflects investment to construct renewable energy production facilities, such as wind, solar and geothermal power plants, and biofuels production plants – among other things. Power grid investment was the third-largest contributor at $310 billion. Grids are a critical enabler for the energy transition, and investment in them will need to rise in the coming years.\n“Last year brought new records for global renewable energy investment. Strong growth in the US and Europe drove the global rise, even as China, the world’s largest renewables market, sputtered, recording an 11% drop. Despite a year of tough headlines, a record amount of offshore wind capacity also reached financial close,” said Meredith Annex, BNEF’s Head of Clean Power and co-author of the report.\nThere was also strong growth in emerging areas such as hydrogen (with investment tripling year on year), carbon capture and storage (near-doubling) and energy storage (up 76%).\n\nThe largest country for investment by far was China, with $676 billion invested in 2023 – equivalent to 38% of the global total. Although China remains dominant, its lead has been reduced. Taken together, the European Union, US and UK outpaced China with $737 billion of investment – a feat they hadn’t managed to achieve in 2022. Investment in the US jumped 22% year-on-year, to $303 billion, as the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act started to be felt.\n\nThe current level of investment in clean energy technologies is not nearly sufficient to set the world on track for net zero by mid-century. According to the report, energy transition investment would need to average $4.8 trillion per year from 2024 to 2030 to align with BNEF’s Net Zero Scenario, a Paris Agreement-aligned trajectory from the 2022 New Energy Outlook. This is nearly three times the total investment observed in 2023.\n“Our report shows just how quickly the clean energy opportunity is growing, and yet how far off track we still are,” said Albert Cheung, Deputy CEO of BNEF. “Energy transition investment spending grew 17% last year, but it needs to grow more than 170% if we are to get on track for net zero in the coming years. Only determined action from policymakers can unlock this kind of step-change in momentum.”\nIn addition, BNEF’s report finds that investment in the global clean energy supply chain, including equipment factories and battery metals production for energy technologies, hit a new record at $135 billion in 2023 (up from just $46 billion in 2020), and is set to surge 
further over the next two years. BNEF projects this figure to rise to $259 billion by 2025, based on currently announced investment plans. In the next two years, only the wind sector needs to increase its supply chain investment to get on track for a net-zero trajectory; the other areas are investing at a sufficient pace.\nAntoine Vagneur-Jones, Head of Trade and Supply Chains at BNEF, said, “Abundant supply chain investment should continue to tamp down equipment prices across most sectors, which is good news for the energy transition. But the ensuing oversupply heralds an era of squeezed margins for solar and battery manufacturers.”\nAside from tracking the funding for clean energy deployment and clean energy supply chain investment, the Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024 report also tracks two other types of funding:\nClimate-tech equity raising: Equity raised by companies focused on climate and the energy transition ($84 billion in 2023)\no This figure has fallen for the past two years, as rising interest rates have made it harder for companies to raise capital. Companies had raised $168 billion in 2021 and $127 billion in 2022.\no Clean energy-focused companies raised more equity than any other sector in 2023, at $49 billion.\no Companies in the clean transport sector saw funding drop the most sharply, from $47 billion raised in 2022 to just $18 billion in 2023. Transport remained the second-largest funding sector, followed 
by Industry, Buildings, Agriculture and ‘Climate and Carbon’.\nEnergy transition debt issuance: Debt issued by companies and governments to fund the energy transition ($824 billion in 2023)\no This figure rose by 4% in 2023 after dropping 10% 
in 2022. Stabilizing or falling interest rates in various markets helped companies and governments raise debt for energy transition purposes and these trends are reflective of the broader market.\no Utilities raised the most debt for the energy transition ($328 billion), followed by financial institutions ($176 billion) and governments ($141 billion)\no Oil and gas companies’ energy transition debt issuance fell to $8.3 billion, down from $17.5 billion in 2022.\nContact\nOktavia Catsaros\nBloombergNEF\n+1 212 617 9209\nocatsaros@bloomberg.net\nAbout Bloomberg\nBloomberg is a global leader in business and financial information, delivering trusted data, news, and insights that bring transparency, efficiency, and fairness

Energy demand, energy productivity, and the U.S. economy all grew in 2024.\n\nThe economy is expanding, and U.S. energy productivity is increasing alongside it.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. economy expanded 2.8 percent, while primary energy consumption grew 0.5 percent year on year, resulting in a 2.3 percent increase in U.S. energy productivity.\nEnergy 
productivity – a measure of economic output per unit of energy consumed in the United States – is an essential metric to grade our country’s competitiveness in the global market.\nOver the past 10 years, U.S. energy productivity has increased 
29 percent.\n\n\nMarket forces are driving demand.\n\nCorporate procurement of renewable energy set a record in 2024, contracting 28 gigawatts (GW), up 34 percent from 20.9 GW in 2022. Tech companies spearheaded this growth, accounting for 84 
percent of overall deal activity.\nIndustry accounted for 33 percent of U.S. energy consumption in 2024, which has risen 5 percent over the past decade.\nNew trends impacting demand include the onshoring of manufacturing, electrification of end-use applications, and increased data center demand for artificial intelligence.\n\nDive In\nIncreasing demand\nEnergy portfolio\nU.S. competitiveness\nInvestment\nImpacts\nPolicy\n2\nBCSE’s diversified, sustainable energy portfolio is ready 
to meet this increasing demand.\n\nNatural gas and renewables provide two thirds of U.S. power.\n\nNatural gas remained the largest electricity generation source, representing 43 percent of total output in 2024.\nRenewable energy’s share grew 
to 24 percent. The contribution of wind, solar, biomass, waste-to-energy, geothermal, and hydropower rose at the fastest pace among all sources of energy consumed across the economy, rising 10.2 percent year on year.\nTogether, natural gas and renewables provided 67 percent of U.S. electricity in 2024, up from 47 percent just a decade ago.\nZero-emission sources – renewables and nuclear – provided 42 percent of all U.S. power.\nIn 2024, generation from coal dropped 4.4 percent year on year. In the past decade, coal-fired generation has seen a steady decline from 33 percent to 15 percent of the U.S. power mix.\n\n\nSolar, storage, and wind power comprised the bulk of the new capacity build.\n\n48.4 GW of new utility-scale power generation and storage capacity was commissioned in 2024 – the highest total since 2003.\nWind and solar accounted for 71 percent of this expansion, at 34.4 GW.\nNatural gas capacity additions totaled 2.4 GW.\n1.1 GW of nuclear capacity was added to the grid.\n\n3\nBy deploying these homegrown sustainable energy solutions, the United States is building a competitive and secure national economy.\n\nSustainable energy investments are bringing manufacturing – and jobs – back to America.\n\nIn 2024, $8 billion was invested across supply chain segments for the hydrogen electrolyzer, wind, solar and battery sectors.\nAdditionally,
    2024 saw 60 new cleantech manufacturing announcements across four sector supply chains, 
bringing total announcements to 264 since August 2022.\nJobs in sustainable energy grew 4.2 percent in 2023, more than twice the rate of the overall economy. More than 3 million Americans are part of today’s sustainable energy workforce.\n\n\nThe proportion of U.S. personal spending on energy is near historic lows.\n\nWhile regional differences in retail prices remain large, U.S. consumer spending on energy – including natural gas, electricity and motor fuel – as a share of total personal expenditures fell 0.3 percentage points in 2024 to 3.8 percent.\n\n4\nWith continued investment in sustainable energy, the United States is poised to lead the world in technology and innovation.\n\nGlobal investment in sustainable energy once again shattered records, soaring to over $2 trillion.\n\nThe United States deployed $338 billion in financing for energy technologies, including renewable energy, EVs, and power grid investment, up from $303 billion in 2023, a 0.8 percent increase year on year. China continued to lead the global market, with $818 billion of investment in 2024, a 20 percent increase year on year.\n\n\nThe United States is the second largest energy storage market in the world after China.\n\nThe United States commissioned a record 11.9 GW of battery storage capacity in 2024.\nPumped hydropower energy storage remains the largest source of storage currently available on the U.S. power grid in terms of storage capacity.\n\n5\nThese investments are more urgent than ever, as extreme weather events intensified in 2024 and U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased.\n\nThe United States continues to face extreme weather events that threaten energy reliability.\n\nIn 2024, the country experienced 27 climate-related disasters, the second highest number of such events since 2010. The total cost associated with these events nearly doubled, reaching $182.7 billion.\n\n\nU.S. economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly in 2024, increasing 0.5 percent year on year.\n\nTransport remained the largest emitting sector of the U.S. economy in 2024. This was followed by industry, which is the fastest growing source of emissions, accounting for 89 percent of te 
 2024 increase. Power sector emissions remained stable.\nAs of 2024, the United States has reduced its economy-wide emissions 15.8 percent below 2005 levels, and power sector emissions have dropped 41 percent.\n\n6\nAs we move forward, the progress of sustainable energy in America faces obstacles – which can be overcome with federal policy support.\n\nU.S. energy infrastructure needs reform of regulatory timelines and processes, to accelerate the pace of U.S. energy expansion and meet rising demand.\n\nIn 2024 alone,
    317 GW of new capacity applied to interconnect in the seven U.S. independent system operators, representing nearly a third of the current installed U.S. power system. Over two-thirds of this new capacity is solar and storage.\nFederal permitting and siting processes cause bottlenecks and leave projects stranded in development for far too long. On federal lands, it can take roughly four years to construct utility-scale wind and solar projects, seven to ten years to obtain a mining permit, and ten years to build a new transmission line.\nAdditionally, carbon capture and storage project plans are increasing, with 146 million tons per annum (Mtpa) of new plants in the U.S. pipeline, against an installed base of 23 Mtpa. Here, permitting challenges are slowing deployment.\n\n\nMaintaining the U.S. federal government’s energy sector investments and energy tax credits will enable forward momentum to continue.\n\nDurable energy tax policies improve American competitiveness. Existing tax credits benefit a broad range of technologies, including biofuels, biomass, carbon capture and storage, combined heat and power,
    , energy efficiency, fuel cells, hydrogen, hydropower, natural gas, nuclear, solar, waste-to-energy, and wind power technologies, among others.\nIn 2024,
    60 new clean tech manufacturing sites were announced, increasing the total to 264 since August 2022, when federal energy tax credits kickstarted 
private investment in homegrown energy.\nBusinesses like predictability. Changing existing energy tax policy would put good-paying American jobs and competitiveness at risk.\n\nRising demand across the United States presents an opportunity to 
deploy a broad portfolio of sustainable energy solutions to unlock a smarter energy system. Federal policy support remains integral to building this energy future to benefit all Americans.\nStay up to date with BCSE\nStay Informed\n\nBCSE Headquarters\n805 15th Street NW, Suite 710\nWashington, DC 20005\nbcse@bcse.org\n+1 202-785-0507\n\n\nFollow\nFollow\nFollow\nFollow\n\n©2025 Business Council for Sustainable Energy • Privacy Policy • Website designed and created by Red Chalk Studios.'

    317 GW of new capacity applied to interconnect in the seven U.S. independent system operators, representing nearly a third of the current installed U.S. power system. Over two-thirds of this new capacity is solar and storage.\nFederal permitting and siting processes cause bottlenecks and leave projects stranded in development for far too long. On federal lands, it can take roughly four years to construct utility-scale wind and solar projects, seven to ten years to obtain a mining permit, and ten years to build a new transmission line.\nAdditionally, carbon capture and storage project plans are increasing, with 146 million tons per annum (Mtpa) of new plants in the U.S. pipeline, against an installed base of 23 Mtpa. Here, permitting challenges are slowing deployment.\n\n\nMaintaining the U.S. federal government’s energy sector investments and energy tax credits will enable forward momentum to continue.\n\nDurable energy tax policies improve American competitiveness. Existing tax credits benefit a broad range of technologies, including biofuels, biomass, carbon capture and storage, combined heat and power,
    , energy efficiency, fuel cells, hydrogen, hydropower, natural gas, nuclear, solar, waste-to-energy, and wind power technologies, among others.\nIn 2024,
    60 new clean tech manufacturing sites were announced, increasing the total to 264 since August 
2022, when federal energy tax credits kickstarted private investment in homegrown energy.\nBusinesses like predictability. Changing existing energy tax policy would put good-paying American jobs and competitiveness at risk.\n\nRising demand across the United States presents an opportunity to deploy a broad portfolio of sustainable energy solutions to unlock a smarter energy system. Federal policy support remains integral to building this energy future to benefit all Americans.\nStay up to date with BCSE\nStay Informed\n\nBCSE Headquarters\n805 15th Street NW, Suite 710\nWashington, DC 20005\nbcse@bcse.org\n+1 202-785-0507\n\n\nFollow\nFollow\nFollow\nFollow\n\n©2025 Business Council for Sustainable Energy • Privacy Policy • Website designed and created by Red Chalk Studios.'
